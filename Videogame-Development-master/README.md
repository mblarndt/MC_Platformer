- DASH: X or L

### Debug
- F1: Load 1st Level
- F2: Load 2nd Level
- F3: Alternate Level
- F5: Save State
- F6: Load State
- F8: Toggle GUI debug
- F9: Toggle Display Colliders / Pathfinding
- F10: Toggle God Mode (while God Mode is on use WASD or ARROWS to fly)
- ยบ: Open/Close console

## Innovation Candidates

Version 0.3:
- Animations are loaded from a .tmx file (via Tiled)
- Colliders and Sensors are created via Object Layers, so we have fewer, larger colliders, improving performance.

Version 0.6:
- No remarcable innovation.

Version 0.9:
- Sound scrollbars work by both clicking and dragging.
-
